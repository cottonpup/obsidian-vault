# How to Learn Stuff Quickly
## Mixing guided and unguided learning
1. **Guided:** Reading a tutorial, taking a course, watching a YouTube video. Anything where you're following a guide.
2. **Unguided:** Creating your own projects from scratch, extending a tutorial, looking things up in the docs. Anything where you aren't following a guide.
### Making intentional mistakes
**I might add it to a list of "things to explore later", if the rabbit hole seems to go too deep.**

> 1. Follow a tutorial verbatim, going through it step by step.
> 2. When you've finished, reset the code to the initial state, and minimize the tutorial. See how far you can get **without looking at the tutorial**. When you get stuck, pull the tutorial back up, but minimize it again once you've unblocked yourself.
> 3. Repeat this process until you can complete the tutorial start-to-finish without looking at the instructions.
### Extending tutorials
공식 튜토리얼을 따라 만든 프로젝트에 원하는 기능을 하나씩 추가해보기
틱택토 프로젝트
- 보드 사이즈 조절가능
- UI 향상
- 얼마나 이겼는지 스코어 트랙킹
- AI 플레이어 추가
- 애니메이션, 사운드 이펙트, 콘페티 추가 
### Building related projects
빙고와 같은 비슷한 프로젝트 빌드하기. 
I've seen this strategy described as "one on, one off". Follow a guided resource like a tutorial, and then spend an equal amount of time creating a similar (but unguided) project. If the tutorial shows you how to build an Instagram clone, try building a Twitter clone on your own!
