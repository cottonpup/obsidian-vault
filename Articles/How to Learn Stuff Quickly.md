# How to Learn Stuff Quickly
## Mixing guided and unguided learning
1. **Guided:** Reading a tutorial, taking a course, watching a YouTube video. Anything where you're following a guide.
2. **Unguided:** Creating your own projects from scratch, extending a tutorial, looking things up in the docs. Anything where you aren't following a guide.
### Making intentional mistakes
**I might add it to a list of "things to explore later", if the rabbit hole seems to go too deep.**

> 1. Follow a tutorial verbatim, going through it step by step.
> 2. When you've finished, reset the code to the initial state, and minimize the tutorial. See how far you can get **without looking at the tutorial**. When you get stuck, pull the tutorial back up, but minimize it again once you've unblocked yourself.
> 3. Repeat this process until you can complete the tutorial start-to-finish without looking at the instructions.
### Extending tutorials
공식 튜토리얼을 따라 만든 프로젝트에 원하는 기능을 하나씩 추가해보기
틱택토 프로젝트
- 보드 사이즈 조절가능
- UI 향상
- 얼마나 이겼는지 스코어 트랙킹
- AI 플레이어 추가
- 애니메이션, 사운드 이펙트, 콘페티 추가 
### Building related projects
빙고와 같은 비슷한 프로젝트 빌드하기. 
I've seen this strategy described as "one on, one off". Follow a guided resource like a tutorial, and then spend an equal amount of time creating a similar (but unguided) project. If the tutorial shows you how to build an Instagram clone, try building a Twitter clone on your own!

## Mindset cultivation
이력서에 좋아보일 것을 빌드하지말고 진심으로 즐기는 것을 빌드하기
## Remembering things
**spaced repetition**
leitner box, a physical box
## Building a daily habit
일요일에 몰아서 7시간 공부하는 것보다 vs 일주일에 7시간을 공부하는 것이 더 효과적
## Learning in public
1. Have you ever tried to explain something to someone, only to realize that you don't quite understand it as thoroughly as you thought you did? Writing a blog post has the same effect. It's the best way to uncover flaws/holes in your mental model, so you can fix them.
2. The worst feeling in the world is hitting a bug that you _know_ you've solved before, but you can't remember how you solved it. If you had written a blog post about it, you could reference it!
3. By sharing what you learn, you become an active participant in the dev community. You can make friends and connections. This can be fun and fulfilling, not to mention beneficial when it comes to finding a new job or starting a new enterprise!
