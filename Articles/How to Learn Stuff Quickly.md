# How to Learn Stuff Quickly
## Mixing guided and unguided learning
1. **Guided:** Reading a tutorial, taking a course, watching a YouTube video. Anything where you're following a guide.
2. **Unguided:** Creating your own projects from scratch, extending a tutorial, looking things up in the docs. Anything where you aren't following a guide.
### Making intentional mistakes
**I might add it to a list of "things to explore later", if the rabbit hole seems to go too deep.**

> 1. Follow a tutorial verbatim, going through it step by step.
> 2. When you've finished, reset the code to the initial state, and minimize the tutorial. See how far you can get **without looking at the tutorial**. When you get stuck, pull the tutorial back up, but minimize it again once you've unblocked yourself.
> 3. Repeat this process until you can complete the tutorial start-to-finish without looking at the instructions.
### Extending tutorials
