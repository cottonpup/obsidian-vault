# How to Learn Stuff Quickly
## Mixing guided and unguided learning
1. **Guided:** Reading a tutorial, taking a course, watching a YouTube video. Anything where you're following a guide.
2. **Unguided:** Creating your own projects from scratch, extending a tutorial, looking things up in the docs. Anything where you aren't following a guide.
### Making intentional mistakes
**I might add it to a list of "things to explore later", if the rabbit hole seems to go too deep.**
