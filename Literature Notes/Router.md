> 라우터는 컴퓨터 네트워크에서 데이터를 송수신하는 장치이다. 인터넷을 통해 데이터를 보낼 때, 데이터가 작은 패킷으로 쪼개지는데 그 패킷을 라우터가 기기끼리 주고 받게 해준다.

> The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. 

> [!note]
> When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.
