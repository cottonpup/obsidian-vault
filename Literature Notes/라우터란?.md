# 라우터란?
The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

A device that directs packets of data between different network.
