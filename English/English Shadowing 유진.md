hi everyone welcome to my video 

this week I'm wanting to film a what I eat in a week video 
I haven't done this in a very very long time but I've been wanting to because I know that it's one of your favorites on my channel that I do as a series but I can't even call it a series anymore because the last time I've done this was like two years ago but I just got back from my trip from New York City and it's **if anything** this week is a perfect week for me to film this because I know I'm gonna want to eat at home 

although I like to cook **I don't like going above and beyond to cook because the cleaning up process just traumatizes terrorizes me** so all of these are gonna be pretty simple and also I am in my friend's house for the next month or so
so that's why you're seeing an unfamiliar kitchen 
I need to start a **apartment hunting** soon so I will have my own space very very soon but until then you're getting this View

**as soon as I landed in LAX first thing that I did was go to the grocery store** 
I went to Trader Joe's **because we love pushing off like our daily errands when we come back from vacation**

but that is the thing that we need to do the most because we need food to eat 
we're going back to our normal routine and we can't not have food in our kitchen so I'm so proud that I did that so now I have food to cook with
the menu that we're making for breakfast today is I'm trying to **recreate this menu that I
had at Ruby's Ruby's is one of my favorite Cafe** in New York City and they have this breakfast
bowl that's quite simple so I feel like I can recreate it and **I purposely bought all the ingredients that I'm going to need for this so that I can read it so I'm going to defrost and heat up this edamame**

next we have to make a **poached egg** 
I have never made a poached egg in my life

some vinegar 
then I have that egg right here
and I'm gonna drop that in 
**why is it not clumping together** 
we have **micro greens** which is **my favorite way to get my greens in here**

and lastly this is a different approach from the Ruby's

because they use a different type of cheese but I just got cottage cheese because I've been seeing a lot of recipes go around with cottage cheese on Tik Tok
and **they're also a really good source of protein**

so they look like this I'm just gonna do like a scoop and mix it in with my edamame 

**let me look back on the photo to see if I did
this right. pretty much. I killed it.** 

**this is the picture I think one thing I do need to do for the visual is to open this poached egg and see if I did it right**

just gotta add salt on top of the egg as well and some pepper 

and **the best way to eat this is take the toast I'm gonna lay down some avocado** first like a little avocado toast I'm gonna add the cottage cheese and edamame and some egg some prosciutto and on top of that, some of the greens

oh my god hot sauce

oh very spicy 



at lunch time and **I got changed from my pajama slash laying around clothes to my gym outfit because I'm gonna head to the gym pretty soon in like 30 minutes but** I always have to eat something before I go to the gym especially if I have a leg day and today is most definitely a leg day so I am going to eat lunch and do some more work before I head out

I'm gonna cheat here a little bit oh **you can't blame me because I did literally just get back from my travels I'm gonna eat** my Trader Joe's pre-made salad these are so good 

**I feel like caesar salads have the rep of being not a healthy salad** but it's better than Taco Bell all right **it might not be the healthiest salad that exists** but it's still a salad anyways it's still a salad it's still kale yes cheese not the healthiest thing ever but cheese is also protein put some chicken in here

if you are also a Trader Joe's lover and you have another favorite Trader Joe's salad please let me know because I would love to try them **one thing about me is that I am not a sauce girl I don't like a ton of sauce so even this** I feel like it's just too much sauce that will make my salad just too wet I'm not gonna pour like everything else I'm just gonna eat that much

I just got to the gym I thought while I'm sharing what I eat in a week might as well share my workouts with you guys as well today is going to be a leg day at the gym 

I normally start off the week with a leg day at the gym but this week all of my workout plans are kind of shifted back because I've been on break for Fourth of July like Monday and Tuesday

but I wouldn't necessarily say that I've been on break because the days that I wore in New York I was walking like 20K steps a day and that is a great workout 

I'm gonna pick up my gym routine with a leg day I've shown this
routine a couple of times on my social media

platforms but I stay on the same workouts
for a period of time and I know people can

get really bored of it I used to get bored
of these workouts when I repeat when I repeated

them back then as well but now I kind of have
passed that period of where I like get bored

and I find comfort in the same moves that
I do every leg day just bumping up the strength

or the weight so that I can also visibly see
that I'm getting stronger and that my forms

are getting better I used to switch out my
workouts like every single time I worked out

and that is great to keep it fun and it does
work but now I'm kind of just settling on

the workouts that works for me great and I
keep it constant and consistent it's my little

on the go snack I'm on my way to go apartment
hunting I just wanted to bring this along

in my car ride which is not gonna be a long
one at all but I've been going through my

savory snack phase or I'm starting to be on
my savory snack phase because I'm always a

chocolate girl but somehow I don't know what
happened but these chips potato chips have

been calling my name I made
a fully Trader Joe's dinner with this new

pasta sauce that I found cajun style alfredo
and I tasted it a little bit while I was cooking

I'm not really sure if I'm gonna like it

but I did some chickens lots of seasoning
cheese on top breadcrumbs everything tempura

cauliflower from Trader Joe's as well another
Trader Joe's favorite that I can't live without

this hot and sweet jalapenos these are so
good and I'm also drinking this Poppi strawberry

lemon prebiotic soda I'm just not really a
drinker overall but

I do like Poppi

or I wanted to eat rice for breakfast because
I haven't had rice in a while but ran out

of rice so I'm gonna have to get creative
here

here I am with my food I wanted to
mention that I definitely experimented with

this one I've never made anything like it
but every day I wake up and just make something

up with what I have because

there's no rule to cooking yes there might
be if you're an actual chef and you go to

a cooking school culinary school there are
rules to follow and if there's like if you're

baking there are rules to follow but if you're
a regular person like me who just needs to

cook to feed ourselves so that we can live
there's no rules we can just do whatever we

want and discover something new

and I gotta say this is pretty good
I am heading to my workout of the day which

is gonna be pilates I actually can't tell
if it's pilates or just a workout class it's

called the Bala the Bala Bengal Barre so I think
it's going to be a bar workout with weights

on our ankles which I've never been to actually
but it is a class that my gym is holding so

I'm gonna go try it out very excited and I
wanted to share my work outfit I'm probably

going to end up taking this headband off because
one thing about me is I don't have like a

lot of volume um back here like my actual
head shape is like pretty flat in the back

so whenever I wear headbands it always slides
off so it's good for like fashion statement

but when I want to wear it to the gym it will
literally just fly off in like a minute so

I will probably end up taking it off but I
am wearing it because it looks cute I'm wearing

my Alo sports bra this is one of my favorites
because the fabric itself is super thick and

there's no like inserted padding into it which
those get annoying because every time I wash

it I have to take them out put them back in
like adjust it to make sure it looks good

and I'm just not about that anymore so this
just eliminates all those extra steps and

then I'm wearing these leggings from a brand
called Noubohe and that's it I'm just gonna

take my purse take my sunnies and wear my
Birkenstocks please

I'm gonna stop by Korean grocery store
before I go home because to realize that we

don't have any rice at home and also just
not enough ingredients to make stews or gigas

or any like official Korean meals so I'm gonna
pick up some ingredients so that I can make

maybe like three different menus for the rest
of the week one problem though is I didn't

think that I would stop by a grocery store
so this is literally what I'm wearing today

and I don't want to be judged by halmonis
so I'm gonna try to dig my car to see if I

have a shirt in the back which I think I do

I'm trying to see what I could eat
as a snack because it's already 3 PM and

I think I'd rather eat a big early dinner
than to eat like a very late lunch so

I think I can eat a bowl of edamame or make
myself a cup of protein smoothie but the thing

with smoothie is right now I'm kind of feeling
sick I've been coughing a lot so I'm not sure

if they'll be bad for my throat like eating
something cold every time I get sick I look

this up and I always forget I don't know if
that's actually a bad thing no it's a myth

maybe I can make myself a smoothie

do I want to eat something cold right now
though

literally the entire bag 

that took a lot of trust because while I was
making it it just looked like spicy pork water

but in the end it worked out thank you YouTube
we have egg rolls and I'm gonna eat that way

ketchup

good morning I had to wake up a little bit
earlier than usual today because I have an

apartment showing that I have to show up at
9 AM which isn't too early but I do wanna start

my day a little bit earlier today eat breakfast
get ready and not rush into the apartment

showing so I'm gonna make myself a quick breakfast
I've also been waking up with headaches the

past two days I've also been a little sick
so I took PM medicine yesterday and today

and maybe somehow the drowsy medicine is also
giving me a headache in order to take Tylenol

also I have to eat something beforehand I'm
going to eat myself a peanut butter and jelly

toast when I was in high school I used to
tell myself that peanut butter jelly toast

is not a healthy breakfast food and it might
not be the most nutritious meal you could

have but I still think it's better than milking
better to eat a peanut butter and jelly toast

than to completely skip a meal just because
you don't think it's nutritious enough I've

been trying different bread from everywhere
like different grocery stores different types

of bread but my favorite right now is like
multigrain breads from Korean bakeries here

it's so soft this is a jam from a cafe here
called The Destroyer they have a lot of seasonal

jams available I'm almost out of this one
but I'm excited to go back and try something

more fun like an orange marmalade or whatever
they have for the summer time

so we're making lunch now it is 12
and I'm starving got one little piece of toast

was not gonna hold me over for lunch I'm gonna
make fried rice and last night I actually

was trying to prep breakfast for today and
for the next few days by making little egg

bites like the egg bites that they sell at
Starbucks and I wanted to make that at home

I knew there wasn't going to be a muffin pan
here in this household but I thought maybe

I could make a little bowl out of aluminum
foil and put it into my air fryer maybe it

will still work this household also does not
have aluminum foil so that idea just went

completely out the window but I still have
all the ingredients that I prepped for the

egg bites including chopped veggies and egg
cottage cheese blended up so that makes my

life easy to make fried rice so I'm just gonna
do that um it's gonna be super easy I'm just

gonna throw all of these veggies into the
pan add the egg into the pan and while they're

like 95% cooked I'm gonna add in my warmed
up rice add some sesame oil add some soy sauce

maybe add some salt and pepper and that's
pretty much it I went apartment shop shopping

apartment shopping I went apartment hunting
earlier today and it's getting me so excited

to have my own space but also to have my own
kitchen and to be able to invest in like cooking

wear now because obviously when I was home
when I was like 18 I that was not my interest

I would rather buy clothes now that I'm 21
about to turn 22

I love looking at cooking wear cookware dishware
silverware anything like that and when I live

in a dorm with other people I could buy nice
cookware or anything you know related to the

kitchen but in the end it gets used by everyone
and it's not the sharing part that I don't

like it's more of like you know if you live
in the dorm it's just doesn't it it's harder

to maintain it in a pristine condition that
you would when you like live alone because

other people can use it and I don't mind other
people using it but it's just

I just wanted to be my own I'm celebrated
that sound if I'm gonna spend like 200 on

a knife like I want to make sure that knife
is getting taken care of and that I'm responsible

for it instead of like being in other people's
hands all the time yeah I'm excited I'm like

starting to look at all these small accessories
that I could buy for my home even though I

don't even have my own place yet but that's
just how it goes I'm always on Facebook Marketplace

trying to look for furniture even though I
don't even know what my place is gonna need

yet in terms of furniture oh my god that was
so much oil this egg mix I don't know how

it's gonna cook because I did blend in cottage
cheese in here

I'm gonna add a decent amount I always like
to make sure that the egg is like 95% cooked

before I add the rice in here because if I
don't do that the rice just turns into like

egg rice and I don't want that 
I want them to be separate

um the house owner brought me back donuts
from the workplace I think because it was

Friday someone brought them and donuts so
I'm gonna eat some of this which is perfect

because I have a tiny bit of coffee left so
this is gonna go perfectly and if you know

me I'm the biggest donut girl I love donuts
I just don't eat them too often so this is

the best day ever for me this is my first
time eating a donut in like four months

happy Friday well it's been Friday but it's
Friday dinner happy Friday dinner for dinner

I'm gonna make this I brought this from home
when I was home for like a week because my

dad was like take everything and he laid out
like every single ramen that we had at home

and I could not bring all of them because
I didn't have a big bag but I did bring this

and I wanted to try and we're gonna make and
I'm also gonna cook pork belly so I can never

go wrong with pork belly if you didn't know
combo but I'm gonna prep this first I first

need to make some rice I'm also gonna crush
up some firm tofu to add more protein and

I'm going to add some washed up kimchi in
there for the for some texture

um came to Erewhon
to try the honey blueberry lavender shake

every month they have like a free menu that
we can get as a member and I don't even have

like the actual immersion I have the cafe
membership this was a free menu and I wanted

to try it because it sounds so yummy

it's not as like dessert as I thought it would

good morning

I'm having a pretty packed busy Saturday because
earlier in the morning I went to the gym put

my leg day as planned and came back got ready
to go to a pool party that Krave Beauty and

Sundae School is throwing it was like three
blocks down so I had to go and there I had

a frozen margarita which was so strong and
then we didn't really eat any food so um picked

up open market sandwich and this is my favorite
sandwich I've ever tried this is this one

that I got specifically is called the Olympic
my personal favorite is called the Normandie

um

the chicken is so juicy but I think the Normandie
is like everyone's favorite because if I don't

go in the morning it's always sold out so
I recommend going early
