- *What is the virtual DOM in React and why is it important?*
	- The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. It compares changes with the actual DOM and updates accordingly. In most cases, it is much faster and more efficient.
		- *You said it's faster in the most case. Then can you tell me when virtual DOM becomes slow?*
			- If you have complex compnents or when there is frequent updates, then it's better to optimize it. (Like using `Memo()`)
- *What is the difference between state and props in React?*
	- State is mutable and you can update by using `setState()` hook. But props are immutable and read-only and it's passed down from the parent component to the child component as an argument.
