# Internet
A network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to eachother.
The internet is a network of networks.
# How the Internet Works
The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

# 인터넷에서의 프로토콜 역할
IP is responsible for routing packets of data to their correct destination, while TCP and UDP ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently. DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, and HTTP is used to transfer data between clients and servers.

# IP 주소와 도메인 이름의 이해
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.

Domain names, on the other hand, are human-readable names used to identify websites and other internet resources. Domain names are translated into IP addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS).

When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or other resource you’ve requested.

# HTTP 와 HTTPS 도입
HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption.

When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser will display a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the connection is secure. You may also see the letters “https” at the beginning of the website address, rather than “http”.
# TCP/IP 를 사용하여 애플리케이션 구축하기
- **Ports**: Ports are used to identify the application or service running on a device. Each application or service is assigned a unique port number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.
- **Sockets**: A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication. Sockets are used to establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications.
- **Connections**: A connection is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other. During the connection establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size, which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.
- **Data transfer**: Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the applications running on each device. Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.

# SSL/TLS 를 사용하여 인터넷 통신 보안화하기
SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet.
- **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity. 
- **Handshake:** During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure connection.
- **Encryption:** Once the secure connection is established, data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.
# 결론
- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that uses a standard set of communication protocols to exchange data.
- The internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using standardized protocols, such as IP and TCP.
- The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers that direct traffic between different devices and systems.
- Basic concepts and terminology that you need to familiarize yourself with include packets, routers, IP addresses, domain names, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS.
- Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet, allowing devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate seamlessly.

Every server has a unique internet protocol address or ID address.

## 누가 인터넷을 운영하나요?
아무도 인터넷을 운영하지 않습니다. 다들 각자의 네트워크를 형성하나, 기술적인 기준은 IETF에 의해 정해집니다. IETF가 승인한 기준을 채택할 필요가 있는 것은 아닙니다. 그러나 IETF 가 승인한 기준들이 일반적으로 추천됩니다. 
## IP 주소란 무엇인가요?
인터넷상 각자의 컴퓨터를 확인하는 숫자를 IP라고 합니다. 
ICANN(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)는 같은 ip 주소가 번복되지 않게 책임을 지는 기관입니다.
## IPv6란 무엇인가요?
IPv6는 IPv4의 주소 고갈 문제를 해결하기 위한 새로운 인터넷 프로토콜입니다.
## 무선 인터넷은 어떻게 작동하나요?
무선 인터넷에는 wifi와 셀룰러 두 유형이 있습니다. Wifi는 라이선스 없는 주파수를 사용하고 가정이나 사업장에서 쉽게 구축 가능하며, 주변 네트워크 간 간섭을 방지하기 위한 전력 제한이 있습니다. 
셀룰러는 중앙집중적이며 서비스 지역을 작은 "셀"로 나누어 타워를 통해 서비스를 제공하며, 장치가 이동할 때 자동으로 연결을 유지합니다. 셀룰러는 라이선스 부여된 주파수를 사용하고 이는 경매로 할당됩니다.

Optical Fiber Network
SSD (Solid State Device)
DNS => Huge phone book

You enter the domain name, the browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the corresponding IP address. After getting the IP address, your browser simply forwards the request to the data center, more specifically to the respective(해당하는) server. Once the server gets a request to access a particular website the data flow starts. 

The router converts these light signals to electrical signals. An Ethernet cable is then used to transmit the electrical signals to your laptop.

However if you are accessing the Internet using cellular data, from the optical cable the signal has to be sent to a cell tower and from the cell tower the signal reaches your cell phone in the form of electromagnetic waves.
