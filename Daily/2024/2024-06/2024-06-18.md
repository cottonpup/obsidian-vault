우울하다..커피챗을 하니까 더 우울해진듯..
이 기회를 통해서 더 성장하면 된다...괜찮아..쓰담쓰담..

"Feels like everybody else has their life figured out while I’m still battling."

I'm not responding to anything else in your post. I'm certain someone else is better equipped to give you advice on that front.

No one has anything figured out. Everyone is simply doing the best they can. Over time, some will learn from their experience and others won't. If you want to come out ahead, always look for opportunities to grow. Always remember that you have the power to change your life and yourself.

At the end of the day, it's much easier to do nothing. But all the reward comes from consistently working towards _something_. Just keep moving in the correct direction. The specifics matter little in the long run.
