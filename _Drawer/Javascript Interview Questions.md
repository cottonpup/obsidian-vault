> [!tip]+ *What is a callback function in JS?*
> A callback is a function passed as an argument of another function.

> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between `undefined` and `null`?*
> Both means no value. But null is an object. null is actual value meaning there is no value. So in JSON, undefined doesn't exist. but null exists. In GraphQL as well. 

> [!tip]+ *What is an async request? What is an async communication?*
> Async communication is allowing a service to communicate more efficiently by sending a request and continue with other tasks while waiting it without blocking.
>> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?*
>>  Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks, so for example, it can process the 20% of task A and switch to the task B and switch back to the A task to complete. While parallelism refers to the ability to start the task A and B at the same time.

> [!tip]+ *What does JSON stand for? What is it used for?*
> It stands for Javascript Object Notation. It's often used in RESTful APIs, where it's used to send and receive data in a standardized way.
 
> [!tip]+ *How would you send out/convert to JSON format?*
> You can use the built-in `JSON.stringify()` method to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string. To receive JSON data, you can use `JSON.parse()` method to convert a JSON string to a JavaScript object.

> [!tip]+ *What is RESTful API?* 
>  RESTful APIs are a communication that utilize HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to access or modify server resources. Endpoints should be stateless, meaning that each request should contain information to fulfill the request, and the server typically defines the format of the resources.

> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between `GET` and `POST`?*
> GET is for getting data from a server, while POST is for submitting data to be processed like update or insertion. GET exposes data in the URL, while POST includes it in the request body. So POST is considered more secure as data is not visible in the URL. And GET has length limits, while POST does not have any specific length limit. 
> - GET update POST send data

> [!tip]+ *What is hoisting?*
> Hoising is being able to use a variable's value in its scope before the line it is declared without throwing an error.

> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?*
>
> `var` is function-scoped and allows variable hoisting, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped and do not allow variable hoisting. Accessing `let` and `const` before their declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the TDZ.
> 
>   > [!tip]+ *What is TDZ?*
>   >
>   > TDZ is called Temporal Dead Zone. It is made for preventing issues with hoisting. The TDZ is a period of time during which a variable cannot be accessed or assigned

> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between bubbling and capturing?*
>
> Bubbling and capturing are event propagation methods in JavaScript. Bubbling starts at the child element and moves up to the parent elements all the way, while capturing starts at the parent element and moves down to the child elements all the way.

> [!tip]+ *What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does it work?*
>
> The event loop is a mechanism that always runs in the background to execute code efficiently. First of all, synchronous code is executed first when the script runs. Asynchronous codes such as callbacks or APIs are added to the task queue. The event loop continuously checks if there are any pending tasks in the task queue until it's empty. The event loop will execute the tasks on the task queue one by one. By using the event loop, JavaScript can handle asynchronous tasks efficiently without blocking.

> [!tip]+ *Explain how closures work in JavaScript.*
>
> Closure refers to the ability of an inner function to access and modify variables that were defined at the same level as the inner function, all within an outer function that returns the inner function. In other words, when you call an outer function that returns an inner function, and variables are defined at the same level as the inner function, closure allows the inner function to still have access to and modify those variables.

> [!tip]+ *What is Scope chain?*
> - First of all, scope is the area determines where in the code it can be accessed. Scope chain refers to the hierarchy having an access to the its parent scope. 
> - Global scope refers to variables, functions, and objects that are accessible from anywhere in the code, while local scope refers to variables, functions, and objects that are accessible only within a specific block of code, such as a function.

> [!tip]+ *What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript? (mention bind(), arrow func)*
> `this` keyword is binding the object in the current context when it was executed. 

> [!tip]+ *Explain the difference between a function declaration and a function expression and an arrow function in JavaScript.*
>  Function declaration has a hoisting like var. So It'ts safer to use function expression.

> [!tip]+ *What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()` in JavaScript?*
> `slice()` creates a new array and return if after manipulation. Whilte, `splice()` returns the original array.

> [!tip]+ *Explain how `async/await` works in JavaScript. and What is the promise in JavaScript?*
 `async` keyword makes a function asyncronous and `await` keyword suspends the function execution until the promise settles. And the promise is an object having three `pending`, `resolve`, `decline` responses dealing with asyncronous functions.

> [!tip]+ *What is the `fetch()` API in JavaScript?*
 `Fetch()` is the API can access and manipulate the HTTP protocol and it has a easier syntax than old API.
