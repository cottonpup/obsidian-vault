- increased the incentive to work even harder, if only to avoid being outpaced and crowded out by others. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=267))
- being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=288))
- While success doesn’t lead to happiness, happiness does contribute to success. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=290))
- who achieve the highest levels of success often have one thing in common, one thing that differentiates them from the pack. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=294))
- As Malcolm Gladwell puts it in Outliers, if you spend ten thousand hours doing something, you become one of the best in the world at it. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=296))
- “I feel happy when ______________.” ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=310))
- Unhappiness happens when your reality does not match your hopes and expectations. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=329))
- It’s the thought, not the actual event, that’s making you unhappy. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=349))
- got totaled in a crash. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=351))
- The same turnaround happens when you find out that the rude person didn’t mean what he said or that you misunderstood what he meant. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=362))
- The vividness of imagination also allows us to magnify the suffering, if we choose to, by adding our own simulated pain: “I’m an idiot for hurting my friend. I’m not good for anything. I deserve to be punished and suffer.” The incremental layer of internal dialogue only leads to deeper and longer suffering by brooding over the story until it makes us miserable. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=391))
- All the thinking in the world, until converted into action, has no impact on the reality of our lives. It does not change the events in any way. The only impact it has is inside us, in the form of needless suffering and sadness. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=396))
- Suffering offers no benefit whatsoever. None! ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=401))
- I was, in reality, given two choices: (a) I could choose to suffer for the rest of my life and it would not bring Ali back, or (b) I could choose to feel the pain but stop the miserable thoughts, do all that I could to honor his memory, and it would still not bring Ali back—though it would make the world just a little bit easier to endure. Two choices. Which would you choose? ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=408))
- Happiness starts with a conscious choice. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=419))
- Life doesn’t play tricks; it’s just hard sometimes. But even then we’re always given two choices: either do the best we can, take the pain, and drop the suffering, or suffer. Either way, life will still be hard. Keep that in mind. You know what to do. Now I’ll show you how to do it. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=420))
- Why do we allow ourselves to worry about a test result when worrying will have no impact on the final outcome? ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=452))
- Annoying bumps on the road also arise when navigating a familiar path—they’re not pleasant, but they are predictable, so you pass them calmly with no stress. The long time it takes you at the checkout counter of the supermarket, you realize, is what you should expect, and so should you expect work to be demanding, your manager to be annoying, and the money to run out at the end of the month.

- the 1990s, neuroscientists confirmed his view; they used neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas of the brain such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=628))
- As per the Happiness Equation, the repetitive loop of thinking of an event, comparing it unfavorably to our expectations, leads to suffering. Our ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=698))
- Taking the best possible action, regardless of the result, is an obvious way to disrupt the cycle. Once an action is taken, our minds focus on the executional elements of what needs to be done, a different part of our brains is engaged, and our thoughts shift to monitor the result of the action rather than incessantly focusing on the same thought. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=701))
- Instead of trying to think about not being at a job you dislike, think about being in another job altogether. Instead of thinking about ending a relationship, think about the new one you would like to start. That’s the way to shift your thinking into happy thoughts. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=789))
- Once you get the hang of it, you’ll become a master at finding the good side of things. They’re always there; ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=815))

- Then I must be my achievements. I’m the inventor of this or the author of that. Who were you before? I’m a self-made millionaire. What if all the money were lost, would the former self-made millionaire not be you? You’re not your achievements. I am the proud owner of a magnolia-black Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe. Who are you fooling? Does the car you drive or the brand you wear determine who you are? If the Rolls-Royce gets stolen, does the thief become you? You’re not your possessions. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=952))
- “What do you mean it’s okay?” you’ll say. “Nothing is ever okay. I’ve earned the right to be unhappy and paid for it with my painful experiences. If suffering is a choice, then I chose to suffer. It is who I am.” Negative personas can be driven by feelings of diminished self-worth, self-pity, guilt, or shame. I’m fat. I’m ugly.

- We use words to define concepts, but there’s no way words can encompass them fully. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=1325))
- I didn’t know despite my years of experience and forced me to reexamine what I thought worked. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H0IOZQ4&location=1365))
- We know that because she went on to write the Harry Potter books as J. K. Rowling and thrill millions of readers around the world. Later she described that period of her life as liberating, allowing her to focus on writing. Life, with all its might, blocked every other path, leaving her only one, and she followed it. She made the most of her path, and two years later she finished her first manuscript. Her full series, in sixty-five languages, has sold more than 400 million copies, making her one of the top-selling authors in history.
