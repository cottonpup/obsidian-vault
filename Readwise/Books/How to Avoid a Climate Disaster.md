## Highlights
- There are two numbers ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=66))
    - Note: The first is 51 billion. The other is zero.
- their lives are getting better. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=74))
- the impact on humans will in all likelihood be catastrophic. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=75))
- “if nothing else changes” is a big If. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=76))
    - Note: big if: used to say that something is not likely 
      ex) They could win if everyone plays his best, but that's a big if.
- We already have some of the tools we need, and as for those we don’t yet have, everything I’ve learned about climate and technology makes me optimistic that we can invent them, deploy them, and, if we act fast enough, avoid a climate catastrophe. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=77))
- about child mortality, ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=84))
    - Note: 아동 사망률
- Nigeria, ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=87))
- I traveled down unlit streets where people were huddling around fires they had built in old oil barrels. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=87))
    - Note: unlit: not provided with lighting.
      huddle around:
- In remote villages, ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=88))
    - Note: remote: 외딴, 외진, 오지의 
      Remote areas are far away from cities and places where most people live, and are therefore difficult to get to.
- so they could cook over an open flame in their homes. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=88))
- reliable access ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=90))
- work. It’s hard to be productive if you don’t have lights to read by. And it’s impossible to build an economy where everyone has job opportunities if you don’t have massive amounts of reliable, affordable electricity for offices, factories, and call centers. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=93))
    - Note: * read by => by: indicating location of a physical object beside a place or object.
      * economy where everyone has job opportunies => economy 를 where 관계 대명사 사용 => 
      - economy: careful management of available resources.
      - where: in or to what situation or condition.
- the late scientist ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=98))
    - Note: (of a specified person) no longer alive.
- per capita income ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=99))
    - Note: 일인당 소득
- The chart plotted various countries’ per capita income on one axis and energy consumption on the other—and made it abundantly clear to me that the two go together: ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=100))
    - Note: 이 차트는 한 축에 여러 국가의 1인당 소득을 표시하고 다른 축에 에너지 소비를 표시했으며 두 축이 함께 간다는 것을 분명히 보여주었습니다.
      plot => mark (a route or position) on a chart.
      on axis => 한 축에

- As all this information sank in, ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=101))
    - Note: sank in (sink in): to become completely known, felt, or understood
- reliable ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=102))
    - Note: consistently good in quality or performance; able to be trusted.
- I started kicking around ideas with some inventor friends of mine. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YRY461Y&location=103))
    - Note: kick around: 
      1 : to wander or pass time aimlessly. 
      2a : to lie about mostly unnoticed or forgotten. 
      b : to undergo consideration usually intermittently over a period of time 
      ex) ideas that have been kicking around for years

- You might be surprised to see that making electricity accounts for just over a quarter of all emissions. I know I was taken aback when I learned this: Because most of the articles I read about climate change focused on electricity generation, I assumed it must be the main culprit.

- We emit greenhouse gases (1) when we use fossil fuels to generate the electricity that factories need to run their operations; (2) when we use them to generate heat needed for different manufacturing processes, like melting iron ore to make steel; and (3) when we actually make these materials, like the way cement manufacturing inevitably creates carbon dioxide.

One day, as we were going over a draft, Melinda and I had a healthy debate about how many times I could use the word “fart” in the letter. She got me down to one.
